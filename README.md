# debian-kit
install debian alongside android

Fork of https://sourceforge.net/projects/debian-kit/

Primary goal is porting to arm64
Secondary is building against current busybox, openwrt etc.

Also intend to simplify by only targeting debian testing.
Rolling, rolling, rolling keep the Distro efforlessly updating :)
